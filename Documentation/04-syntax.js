// How to use variables:

//JS VARIABLES
//In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
//uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
let x;
x = 6;
//In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

//JS OPERATORS
//JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values

// JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:
let a, b;
a = 5;
b = 6;

//JS EXPRESSIONS
// An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
//The computation is called an evaluation.
 5 * 10 //evaluates to 50:

//Expressions can also contain variable values:
x * 10
//The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
"John" + " " + "Doe" //evaluates to "John Doe":

//JavaScript Keywords
//let tells the browser to create variables:

//var also tells the browser to create variables
var x, c;
x = 5 + 6;
c = x * 10;

//Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

/*A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
*/

//JavaScript is Case Sensitive
/*
The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:
*/
let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
//JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.
//Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

/**
 * Underscore:
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

* Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

* Lower Camel Case:
(JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter)
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

//JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
//Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
