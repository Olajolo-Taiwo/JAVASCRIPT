JavaScript Object Methods
Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

A method is a function definition stored as a property value.

Property	Value
firstName	John
lastName	Doe
age	50
eyeColor	blue
fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
Example
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
In the example above, this refers to the person object:

this.firstName means the firstName property of person.

this.lastName means the lastName property of person.

Accessing Object Methods
You access an object method with the following syntax:

objectName.methodName()
If you invoke the fullName property with (), it will execute as a function:

Example
name = person.fullName();
If you access the fullName property without (), it will return the function definition:

Example
name = person.fullName;

Adding a Method to an Object
Adding a new method to an object is easy:

Example
person.name = function () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};
Using JavaScript Methods
This example uses the JavaScript toUpperCase() method to convert a text to uppercase:

Example
person.name = function () {
  return (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName).toUpperCase();
};
